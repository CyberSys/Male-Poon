# Male Poon web browser

This is the source code for the Male Poon web browser, a nice poon browser derived from MoonchildProductions' Pale Moon/UXP code. The source tree is
laid out in a "comm-central" style configuration where only the code specific to our beloved Male Poon is kept in this repository.

The shared Unified XUL Platform-Fixed source code is referenced here as a git submodule contained in the `platform/` directory and is required to build the application.

## Getting the platform sub-module
`git submodule init && git submodule update`
